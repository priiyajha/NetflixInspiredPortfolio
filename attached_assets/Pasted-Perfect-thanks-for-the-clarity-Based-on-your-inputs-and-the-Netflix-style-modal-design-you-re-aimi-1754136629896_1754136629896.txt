Perfect, thanks for the clarity. Based on your inputs and the Netflix-style modal design you're aiming for, here's a **detailed prompt you can use on Replit** to generate the feature.

### 🎯 **Prompt for Replit (Netflix-style Project Modal)**

Use this in a Replit HTML + Tailwind + JS/React project:

---

**📌 Prompt:**

> Build a Netflix-style project detail modal for my portfolio. When a project card is clicked, it should open a fullscreen modal overlay similar to Netflix's movie detail view.
>
> **Top Section Layout (Video Background):**
>
> * Use a video element as a background header, autoplayed, looped, and muted by default.
> * Add a **volume button** on the bottom-right of the video for mute/unmute toggle (exactly like Netflix).
> * Overlay a bold project title at the bottom-left of the video (like “MOM” in the reference).
> * Below the title, place **two horizontally aligned buttons**:
>
>   * Left: "▶ Restart Video"
>   * Right: "+ Add to List" (with an outlined white border and partial opacity)
> * Place a plus icon and like icon beside the buttons, styled to match Netflix layout.
>
> **Description Section:**
>
> * Just below the buttons, include a short 1000-character limit description. For now, add dummy text (Lorem Ipsum or a product summary placeholder).
> * Use clean, readable sans-serif typography with Netflix-style spacing.
>
> **Details Section (Below Description):**
> Add an “About \[Project Title]” section that includes:
>
> * **Director**: \[Placeholder Name]
> * **Cast**: \[Names or Team Members]
> * **Challenge**: \[Short one-liner]
> * **Role**: \[E.g., Solo builder, PM + Developer]
>
> Keep labels bold and values slightly faded or lighter gray, similar to Netflix UI.
>
> **“More Like This” Section (3x2 grid):**
>
> * Show 6 project cards in 2 rows with 3 columns.
> * Each card must show:
>
>   * Project thumbnail
>   * Duration (e.g., 1h 53m)
>   * Tag (e.g., Year and maturity tag like U/A 16+)
>   * Short description (2 lines max)
>   * Hover effect that subtly enlarges the card and shows a + icon
> * Clicking any card should **open the same modal component** with that project’s data (video, title, description, etc.).
>
> **Design Guidelines:**
>
> * Match fonts, spacing, and card shadows as seen in the Netflix UI
> * Use TailwindCSS for layout and responsiveness
> * Use minimal, clean design with a dark background (`bg-[#141414]`) and white/gray text
> * Ensure modal is fully responsive for desktop and tablet
> * Overlay should be dismissible via ESC key or a close (×) button on top right
>
> **Bonus:** Add subtle fade transitions when opening/closing modal and while switching between projects.

Would you like me to turn this into actual starter code (HTML + Tailwind + JS or React) as well? I can generate that next.

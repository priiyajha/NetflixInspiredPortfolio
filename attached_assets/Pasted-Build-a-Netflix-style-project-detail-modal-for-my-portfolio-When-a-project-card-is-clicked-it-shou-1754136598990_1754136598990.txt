Build a Netflix-style project detail modal for my portfolio. When a project card is clicked, it should open a fullscreen modal overlay similar to Netflix's movie detail view.
Top Section Layout (Video Background):
Use a video element as a background header, autoplayed, looped, and muted by default.
Add a volume button on the bottom-right of the video for mute/unmute toggle (exactly like Netflix).
Overlay a bold project title at the bottom-left of the video (like “MOM” in the reference).
Below the title, place two horizontally aligned buttons:
Left: "▶ Restart Video"
Right: "+ Add to List" (with an outlined white border and partial opacity)
Place a plus icon and like icon beside the buttons, styled to match Netflix layout.
Description Section:
Just below the buttons, include a short 1000-character limit description. For now, add dummy text (Lorem Ipsum or a product summary placeholder).
Use clean, readable sans-serif typography with Netflix-style spacing.
Details Section (Below Description): Add an “About [Project Title]” section that includes:
Director: [Placeholder Name]
Cast: [Names or Team Members]
Challenge: [Short one-liner]
Role: [E.g., Solo builder, PM + Developer]
Keep labels bold and values slightly faded or lighter gray, similar to Netflix UI.
“More Like This” Section (3x2 grid):
Show 6 project cards in 2 rows with 3 columns.
Each card must show:
Project thumbnail
Duration (e.g., 1h 53m)
Tag (e.g., Year and maturity tag like U/A 16+)
Short description (2 lines max)
Hover effect that subtly enlarges the card and shows a + icon
Clicking any card should open the same modal component with that project’s data (video, title, description, etc.).
Design Guidelines:
Match fonts, spacing, and card shadows as seen in the Netflix UI
Use TailwindCSS for layout and responsiveness
Use minimal, clean design with a dark background (bg-[#141414]) and white/gray text
Ensure modal is fully responsive for desktop and tablet
Overlay should be dismissible via ESC key or a close (×) button on top right
Bonus: Add subtle fade transitions when opening/closing modal and while switching between projects.
